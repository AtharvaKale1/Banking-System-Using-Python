## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Banking_System_Using_Python_Edunet.git
   cd Banking_System_Using_Python_Edunet
   ```

2. **Run the main program**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> ⚠️ Make sure you're using **Python 3.6+**. This project uses binary file handling, so run it from your terminal (not an online IDE).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Strong grasp of **Object-Oriented Programming**
* Real-world simulation of a **banking workflow**
* Understanding **file operations** (read, write, update, delete)
* Applying **modular coding principles**
